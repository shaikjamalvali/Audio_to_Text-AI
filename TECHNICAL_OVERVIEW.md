Project Overview: This is a desktop application that converts speech to text in real-time using the Whisper model, but optimized with CTranslate2 for better CPU performance. It was developed to provide an efficient solution for speech-to-text conversion without requiring powerful GPU hardware.

Architecture & Components:

a) GUI Layer (gui/main_window.py):

Built using PySide6 (Qt for Python)
Provides a user-friendly interface with recording controls
Features model selection and settings configuration
b) Core Components:

Controller (controller.py): Acts as the central coordinator
Audio Management (manager.py): Handles audio recording
Model Management (core/models/): Manages Whisper model loading and configuration
Transcription Service: Processes audio and generates text
Technical Implementation:
a) Audio Recording Process:

Uses a separate thread for recording (RecordingThread)
Records at 44.1kHz sample rate with mono channel
Saves recordings as temporary WAV files
Implements signal/slot pattern for async operations
b) Model Handling:

Supports multiple Whisper model sizes
Uses CTranslate2 for optimized inference
Implements model quantization for better CPU performance
Handles model downloading and caching
The Process Flow:
When a user starts recording:

AudioManager creates a new recording thread

Audio is captured through the system microphone

When recording stops:

Audio is saved to a temporary file
File is passed to the transcription service
Whisper model processes the audio
Text is generated and copied to clipboard
Key Technical Features:

Asynchronous Operations: Uses Qt's signal/slot mechanism
Resource Management: Proper handling of audio streams and model resources
Error Handling: Comprehensive error catching and user feedback
Memory Efficiency: Proper cleanup of temporary files and resources
Optimization Considerations:
CPU Optimization: Uses CTranslate2 instead of direct PyTorch
Memory Management: Efficient handling of audio buffers
Performance: Separate threads for UI and processing
Resource Usage: Smart model loading and unloading
Development Scenario: This project was likely developed to address the need for:
Local speech-to-text processing (privacy)
CPU-optimized performance (accessibility)
Real-time transcription capabilities
User-friendly interface for non-technical users
The architecture follows clean code principles with:

Separation of concerns
Modular design
Clear communication patterns
Robust error handling
This makes the application both maintainable and extensible, while providing a smooth user experience for speech-to-text conversion.
